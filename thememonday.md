### What?

[\#ThemeMonday](https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/thememonday) (live hashtag) on App.net has a simple premise; a group of like-minded people change their avatars on or around the second Monday of every month, to a theme chosen by them after shortlisting and then a vote.  ([More](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=ThemeMonday), though now out-of-date, at the App.net Wiki.)

### Tentative timeline:    
(Starting a week prior.)

1. Weekend: Ask for suggestions,
2. Thursday evening: Create poll,
5. Saturday evening/Sunday morning: Announce result!
