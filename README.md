# OBSOLETE - SEE MY LATER VERSION

## (My bazbt3.github.io repo is now unforked from the original.)

---

## A simple blog, done in a complex manner.

### What:

My test blog - at **[bazbt3.github.io.](http://bazbt3.github.io/)**

---

This uses the [poole/hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) repo as its base.

1. I didn't stand a cat in hell's chance of doing this myself, I simply don't currently have the skills or desire to code to this level.
2. I don't intend to spend *much* time fiddling here, but it's an interesting idea.

See [README.md](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/README.md) (the original) for more technical details.
